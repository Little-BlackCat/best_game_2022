*First Project Data Pipeline*

## Building a simple ETL Data Pipeline 

### Introduction 

The key of data engineer is designing and building pipelines that transform and transport data into a desired format, when it reaches end users, it is in a highly usable state. These pipelines must take data from many disparate sources and collect them into a single warehouse that represents the data uniformly as a single source of truth. 

In this project, it's my first time to build ETL, I will take a few tools that I have studied. The goal of this project is to apply my knowledge of data engineers and the selection of tools to create ETL in entry-level.

### What is ETL?

The Extract, Transform, Load process (short: **ETL**) describes the steps between collection data from various sources to the point where it can finally be stored in a *data warehouse* solution.
